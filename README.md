## 2. Timeline
Project start to end: September 2024

## 3. Scope of Work
This tool rapidly analyzes hundreds of quantitative strategy research papers, providing comprehensive insights into specific quant strategy domains. It leverages **OpenAI API** and **LangChain** to automate document processing and summarization, helping users quickly extract key findings, trading strategies, and performance metrics, among other details.

## 4. Process and Approach
Input: Hundreds of trading paper files (PDF, DOC, CSV, etc.).  
Output: Structured summaries of each paper in CSV files, serving meta-analysis of specific research domains and quantitative strategy development.  
Process and Features:  
- AI Summarization: Uses **OpenAI API** (e.g., GPT-4o-mini) to explore and structurally summarize hundreds of input research paper files.
- LangChain Integration: Processes various document types (PDFs, text files) and structures outputs for analysis.
- Parallel Processing: Handles multiple documents concurrently for scalability.
- Structured Output: Exports results to CSV files for easy comparison and review.
- Automated Cleanup: Removes processed files after analysis.

## 5. Outcome
See file `Output_PaperSum.xlsx`, which summarizes 150 papers surrounding three quant market-neutral strategies related to Options, News, and Fundamentals, respectively. This serves as a background for the three real best Alphas submitted to the competition in the Global Final round.
